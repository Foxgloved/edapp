## Overview

This comprehensive training plan is designed to protect food service businesses and employees from phishing attacks, social engineering, and common scams targeting the hospitality industry. With restaurants increasingly relying on digital systems for orders, payments, and communications, cybersecurity awareness has become essential for all staff members.

**Target Audience:** All food service employees from front-line staff to management  
**Industry Focus:** Restaurants, cafes, catering services, food delivery operations  
**Training Duration:** 2-4 hours (initial) + quarterly refreshers  
**Last Updated:** November 2025

### Why This Training Matters for Food Service

The food service industry faces unique cybersecurity challenges:
- **High employee turnover** - New staff need quick, effective training
- **Payment card data** - POS systems are prime targets for criminals
- **Third-party vendors** - Multiple suppliers and delivery platforms create vulnerability
- **Limited IT resources** - Many establishments lack dedicated security staff
- **Time pressure** - Fast-paced environment leaves little room for security verification
- **Public Wi-Fi** - Guest networks can expose business systems
- **Supplier fraud** - Invoice scams targeting accounts payable
- **Gift card scams** - Criminals exploit gift card systems

**Statistics:**
- 43% of small businesses experienced a cyberattack in 2024
- Average cost of a data breach for restaurants: $125,000 - $500,000
- 91% of cyberattacks start with a phishing email
- 74% of successful breaches in hospitality involve the human element

## Introduction to Phishing and Scams

### What is Phishing?

**Phishing** is a type of cyberattack where criminals impersonate legitimate organizations or individuals to trick people into revealing sensitive information, clicking malicious links, or transferring money.

**Common Forms:**
- **Email Phishing:** Fake emails that appear to be from trusted sources
- **SMS Phishing (Smishing):** Fraudulent text messages
- **Voice Phishing (Vishing):** Phone calls from scammers
- **Spear Phishing:** Targeted attacks using personal information
- **Whaling:** Attacks targeting executives and managers

### How Phishing Works

**The Typical Phishing Attack Cycle:**

1. **Research:** Attackers gather information about your restaurant
2. **Bait:** Create convincing fake messages (emails, texts, calls)
3. **Hook:** Use urgency, fear, or authority to pressure victims
4. **Exploit:** Steal credentials, install malware, or trick victims into wire transfers
5. **Damage:** Unauthorized access, data theft, financial loss

### Red Flags: Signs of a Phishing Attack

**Email Warning Signs:**
- ⚠️ Unexpected or unsolicited messages
- ⚠️ Urgency or threats ("Your account will be closed!")
- ⚠️ Suspicious sender email addresses
- ⚠️ Generic greetings ("Dear Customer")
- ⚠️ Spelling and grammar errors
- ⚠️ Requests for sensitive information
- ⚠️ Suspicious links or attachments
- ⚠️ Too good to be true offers

**Phone Call Warning Signs:**
- ⚠️ Unsolicited calls requesting sensitive information
- ⚠️ Pressure to act immediately
- ⚠️ Caller refuses to provide callback number
- ⚠️ Requests for remote access to computers
- ⚠️ Threatening language or consequences

**Text Message Warning Signs:**
- ⚠️ Unknown sender numbers
- ⚠️ Shortened URLs or suspicious links
- ⚠️ Requests to verify account information
- ⚠️ Fake delivery notifications

## Common Scams in Food Service

### 1. Invoice and Vendor Scams

**How It Works:**
Criminals impersonate legitimate suppliers and send fake invoices or change payment instructions for real invoices.

**Real-World Example:**
> A restaurant receives an email appearing to be from their produce supplier: "We've updated our banking information. Please use the new account details for all future payments." The restaurant pays $15,000 to the fraudulent account before discovering the scam.

**Warning Signs:**
- Unexpected changes to payment instructions
- Requests to update banking details via email
- Pressure to pay immediately
- Slight variations in email addresses (e.g., sysco-foods.com vs syscofods.com)

**Prevention:**
- ✓ Always verify payment changes by calling the vendor at a known number
- ✓ Never rely solely on email for banking changes
- ✓ Implement dual authorization for payment changes
- ✓ Maintain updated vendor contact lists

### 2. POS System and Tech Support Scams

**How It Works:**
Scammers call claiming to be from your POS provider, payment processor, or IT support company, requesting remote access to "fix" urgent issues.

**Real-World Example:**
> A caller claims to be from the restaurant's POS system provider: "We've detected suspicious activity on your system. I need you to install this software so I can secure your credit card data." The "software" is actually malware that steals customer payment information.

**Warning Signs:**
- Unsolicited calls about system problems
- Requests for remote access credentials
- Urgency about credit card security
- Requests to install software or visit suspicious websites

**Prevention:**
- ✓ Verify caller identity by hanging up and calling official support number
- ✓ Never provide remote access credentials over the phone
- ✓ Have a verified list of IT support contacts
- ✓ Implement caller verification procedures

### 3. Gift Card and Payment Scams

**How It Works:**
Criminals impersonate managers, suppliers, or authorities demanding payment via gift cards, wire transfers, or cryptocurrency.

**Real-World Example:**
> An employee receives a text message appearing to be from the restaurant owner: "Emergency - I'm in a meeting and need you to buy $500 in gift cards for a supplier payment. Send me the codes ASAP." The "owner" is actually a scammer.

**Warning Signs:**
- Requests to pay bills with gift cards
- Boss requesting purchases via text without prior discussion
- Unusual payment methods for routine transactions
- Pressure to act quickly without verification

**Prevention:**
- ✓ Establish clear policies: NO business payments via gift cards
- ✓ Verify all payment requests from managers via phone call
- ✓ Create approval workflows for unusual payment methods
- ✓ Train staff that legitimate businesses don't use gift cards for payment

### 4. Employment and Payroll Scams

**How It Works:**
Fake job applications, phishing emails targeting employee payroll information, or W-2 scams during tax season.

**Real-World Example:**
> During tax season, the restaurant's payroll administrator receives an email from what appears to be the owner: "I need all employee W-2 forms for our accountant immediately." The administrator sends the sensitive data to a criminal who uses it for identity theft.

**Warning Signs:**
- Unusual requests for employee personal information
- Requests to change direct deposit information via email
- Fake job applications with suspicious attachments
- W-2 requests outside normal procedures

**Prevention:**
- ✓ Verify all payroll information requests via phone or in person
- ✓ Never send W-2s or employee data via unsecured email
- ✓ Implement strict protocols for direct deposit changes
- ✓ Screen job applicant attachments carefully

### 5. Delivery Platform and Online Order Scams

**How It Works:**
Criminals impersonate food delivery platforms (DoorDash, Uber Eats, Grubhub) to steal restaurant login credentials or payment information.

**Real-World Example:**
> A restaurant receives an email: "Your DoorDash account has been suspended due to suspicious activity. Click here to verify your account within 24 hours or lose access to the platform." The link leads to a fake login page that captures credentials.

**Warning Signs:**
- Account suspension threats
- Links to login pages (instead of directing you to the official app/site)
- Requests for sensitive information via email
- Unusual sender email addresses

**Prevention:**
- ✓ Never click links in unexpected emails - go directly to the official platform
- ✓ Enable two-factor authentication on all delivery platform accounts
- ✓ Verify communications by logging into official apps
- ✓ Report suspicious messages to the platform

### 6. Health Inspection and Compliance Scams

**How It Works:**
Scammers impersonate health inspectors or regulatory officials to extort money or steal information.

**Real-World Example:**
> A caller claims to be from the health department: "You failed your inspection yesterday. Pay a $1,500 reinspection fee immediately to avoid closure." In reality, there was no inspection and no fine.

**Warning Signs:**
- Demands for immediate payment over the phone
- Threats of immediate business closure
- Requests for credit card information
- Refusal to provide official documentation

**Prevention:**
- ✓ Health departments send official written notices
- ✓ Verify inspector credentials before allowing access
- ✓ Call your local health department to confirm inspections
- ✓ Legitimate fees have formal payment procedures

### 7. Social Media and Online Review Scams

**How It Works:**
Fake negative reviews with demands for payment to remove them, or phishing attempts through social media messages.

**Real-World Example:**
> A restaurant receives a message on Facebook: "I left you a 1-star review due to food poisoning. Pay me $500 and I'll remove it." This is extortion, not a legitimate customer complaint.

**Warning Signs:**
- Review removal offers for payment
- Threats of negative publicity unless paid
- Suspicious direct messages asking for account access
- "Verification" requests for business pages

**Prevention:**
- ✓ Never pay to remove reviews - report extortion attempts
- ✓ Verify unusual messages through official platform channels
- ✓ Enable two-factor authentication on all social media accounts
- ✓ Train staff on proper social media security

### 8. Utility and Business Services Scams

**How It Works:**
Criminals impersonate utility companies (electric, gas, internet) threatening immediate service disconnection unless payment is made.

**Real-World Example:**
> During lunch rush, a caller claims: "This is the electric company. Your account is past due. Pay $800 in the next hour or we'll shut off your power." The restaurant panics and pays via wire transfer to avoid disruption. The bill was actually current.

**Warning Signs:**
- Threats of immediate service disconnection
- Demands for immediate payment
- Unusual payment methods (gift cards, wire transfers, cryptocurrency)
- Calls during business hours designed to create panic

**Prevention:**
- ✓ Verify your account status directly with the utility company
- ✓ Legitimate companies provide multiple notices before disconnection
- ✓ Establish primary contact for utility communications
- ✓ Keep utility account information accessible for verification
